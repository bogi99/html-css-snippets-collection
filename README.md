### small collection of css and html login and other forms ###

Public domain as far as i am concerned, nothing special just a few timesavers for the front end of things. a couple of nice pictures.

These are not complete implementations, rather a set of snippets that can be used and modified as needed. 

It is not a bug when these don't actually work. As i build more,
i will be adding them to this repo. it makes finding them simpler.
